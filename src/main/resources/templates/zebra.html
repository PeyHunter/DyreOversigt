            <p>
                Zebras (US: /ˈziːbrəz/, UK: /ˈzɛbrəz, ˈziː-/)[2] (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive
                black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra
                (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three
                being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each
                individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting
                them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of
                habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.

                Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions,
                and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains
                and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares,
                and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species,
                adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract
                females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial
                expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.
