            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
            terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one
            species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them
            into four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual
            species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known
            from the fossil record.

            The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and
            spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative,
            the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in
            the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is
            leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most
            other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.
