        <p>
            Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large, semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa,
            Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term “crocodile” is sometimes used more loosely to include all extant members of the
            order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (both members of the family Alligatoridae), the gharial and
            false gharial (both members of the family Gavialidae) as well as other, extinct, taxa.

            <br> <br>
            Although crocodiles, alligators, and the gharial are similar in appearance, they belong to separate biological families.
            The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot
            in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower
            and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is
            that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or
            outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in
            the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth
            tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is
            the most reliable feature to define the species' family.[1] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can
            better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in
            alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.[2]
